# Getting stickers

A project can use marketing. Getting the project known out there. Get the
message out that this project exists. One way to do that is to produce and get
stickers out to people. Stickers are surprisingly popular among certain crowds
and sometimes it seems that the hunger and lust for small logos with glue on
them cannot be satisfied.

As a maintainer of a project you will at times be looked upon or asked to
provide stickers, t-shirts, hats or other merchandise with your team logo on
them. It is hard area to actually make money from, but they are products that
can help create a bond and team spirit. It is fun and encouraging that there
are a bunch of people out there who wants nothing more than to put the symbol
of your project onto the covert of their laptops.

One hard to circumvent problem with merchandise is that they are physical
goods so it immediately gets expensive to send out to people all over the
world. That is of course also why it is so popular to hand out stickers on
conferences and meetups.
