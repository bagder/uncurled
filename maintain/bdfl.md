# BDFL

The **Benevolent Dictator For Life** is a term for an Open Source project
leadership model that is commonly used, where the individual who created the
project remains the leader and ultimately has the final say and veto on
decisions. Oftentimes this power is only implied and silent, not actually
written down or pronounced anywhere.

Like with any dictatorship, it is an effective and speedy model as in it can
avoid long and tiresome debates or voting procedures with a single person's
view and guidance to keep the course straight. If the dictator takes the wrong
turn however, or makes their decrees against what you think is the right way,
the model breaks fairly quickly.

I have worked in several projects with benevolent dictators and I am myself a
BDFL some places. In my view, that is not an ideal way to run a project by any
means. Not even if you are the BDFL. It is hard to know where to go and what
decisions to make. As a BDFL, I have always made a serious effort to listen in
what people say, what they want and where the world seems to suggest is a
suitable place for the project to set its next tent pole.
