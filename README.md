Open Source - how hard can it be?

I have been actively involved in open source development since the early 1990s
when I discovered the phenomenon of people writing source code they give away
for free to use and modify under a certain license.

I have started, lead and maintained many projects over several decades, out of
which the most known one is probably [the cURL project](https://curl.se) I
founded and have been leading since 1998. I have contributed to and
participated in many more projects and I have of course used and kept myself
up-to-date with a large amount of projects in which I did not personally
participate.

I have worked exclusively with Open Source professionally since 2014 for
Mozilla and since 2019 for wolfSSL.

Because of my background and life with Open Source and probably a lot because
of the relative successes some of my projects have had, I frequently get
questions about subjects related to maintaining Open Source. How to run a
project and what makes them succeed? For a long time I have been collecting
lessons from my life with open source into a list of advice for fellow open
source library hackers. This document is my attempt to convert those thoughts
and experiences into words.

This document is written with you as the intended reader. You are someone who
is keen and interested in Open Source to get started or maybe you already are
a maintainer and want to get further insights in how other maintainers go
about doing Open Source. You might do Open Source on your spare time or work
on it full-time as a paid employee.

I am not suggesting that everything I write in there will be a match for you
or a good idea for everyone. One of the best features with Open Source is that
there are always more than one way to do things and that everyone is always
free to go their own way should they decide to. I give you my take and my
advice. You are free to decide what to do with it.

I suppose this is another one of those things we all end up doing: Write a
printf() implementation, create an IRC bot and author a book about Open
Source.
