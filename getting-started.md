# Getting started

There has never been a better time to get started with Open Source or to
release your project as Open Source than right now. There are better and more
*free* and no-cost infrastructure available than ever before. There are
probably also more Open Source developers out there in a community that never
has been this large before.

Now is a perfect time to get into Open Source.

## Just do it

As the old saying goes: *"perfect is the enemy of the good"*. Do not wait. Do
not clean up your code first. Do not fall into the trap of "I just need
to... before I Open Source this."

The sooner your code is made open and available, the sooner you can attract
users, fellow contributors and it becomes obvious that your project is out
there.

No one expects it to be perfect to start with. Your work on improving the
project will be seen as active work on the project - a good thing. Be frank
and open: document the state, explain to your audience what they should and
could expect from the project as of right now.

Encourage users to try it out. Ask them for feedback early on. Feedback is the
fertilization you need to learn to appreciate and act on.

## On license

If you create your own project, you get a chance to select a license for it.

Make sure you select a known, public and established existing Open Source
license for your project. It should have been vetted the [Open Source
Initiative](https://opensource.org/). Never, ever, create your own.

Select a license that matches what you want your project and code to be and
how it should be allowed to be used or not. Whatever your choice lands on, you
can be certain that there will sooner or later be someone with opinions about
the one you picked who would prefer you use another.

It might not be easy to change the license down the line.

## Attracting developers and a community

There is only one main and foolproof way to attract user (who then might
become contributors and developers): make an open source project that is
attractive and compelling. Make a product people want and do it in a project
that makes contibutors want to come and to stay around and help out.

Contributor prospects will initially come for the main features and functions
of your project, but they will not stick around and help out if the "softer"
areas of the project are not also "attractive" enough. What license is
used. How high the bar is set for getting started to contribute. But also what
language is used - both programming and spoken. And when it comes to spoken or
written language, it means both which language as in English or Spanish and in
how the specific language is used in issues and discussions and more.

Attracting contributors to a project is about marketing, but you cannot
lie. You really must deliver on what you claim about your project. By making
your project appear as nice as possible - because it is - you increase the
chances of finding users and contributors.
