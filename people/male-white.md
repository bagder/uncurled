# Contributors are mostly male white westerners

Getting a fair share of women or people that are not white men from a western
country is hard.

As an Open Source project I think we should all strive to wipe out any kind of
treating people differently depending on some particular characteriscs, be it
sex, religion or whatever. But the harsh reality is that the Open Source world
is still consisting mostly of these stereotypes. And I am one of them, I am no
exception.
