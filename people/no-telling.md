# People use your code without telling

Getting your code into Linux distributions, commercial unix distributions or
companion packages etc is great fun but often happens without you getting to
know about it, and you also rarely get any comments or feedback from those
users.

Application authors or product manufacturers will also just get your stuff,
build it and use it and not tell you about them using your product. This is of
course perfectly within their rights. I tell you this because you could
perhaps be under the impression that people would tell you these things.

## How to find out that someone uses your code

1. The user of your project runs into an issue and asks for help in a project
   forum - without hiding where they come from or what product they make
2. While vanity-searching you find your project's Open Source license
   mentioned for or bundled with a product
3. A user email you asking funny questions about a product you never heard of,
   and then you realize they found your email because that product uses your
   code and your license has your email
