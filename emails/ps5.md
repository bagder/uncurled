## Fix the gamepad

    Subject: Drift gamepad on PS5

    Hello.
    In the updated version of the Ghost of Tsushima for the PlayStation 5
    console, there was a problem, the control of the left stick is too
    sensitive and therefore the character itself moves. Drift compensation
    in game settings doesn't help.
    Correct it if possible. Thanks.

## Possible bug

    Subject: possible bug

    Hi. I didn't find other way to contact with PoB developers, so writing here -
    please redirect this letter to proper people.
    I think i found bug
    when i'm using nightblade support (with dual strike for example) while having
    varunastra equipped (2 obviously), it doesn't add any crit multi to my main skill
    while under elusive effect. (elusive checked at Configuration)
    Supported Skills can only be used with Claws or Daggers looks like nightblade
    don't recognize that my varunastra counts as all weapon types
    i swapped varunastras for Rive claw for test, and it's working flawlessly!
