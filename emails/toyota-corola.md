# I have Toyota Corola

Modern cars have fancy infotainment setups, big screens and all sorts of
computers with networked functionality built-in. Part of that fanciness is
increasingly often a curl install. curl is a part of several standard software
offers for cars and is used in lots of other independent software installs as
well.

This usually has a minuscule affect on my every day. I am of course thrilled
over hundreds of millions of more curl installations in the world but the
companies that ship curl for these vehicles normally do not contact me and
curl is a really stable product so not a lot of them speak up on the issue
trackers or mailing lists either (or if they do, they do not tell us where
they come from or what they are working on).

The main effect is however that normal end users can find my email address in
the curl license text in products in cars to a higher degree. They usually
find it in the *about window* or an Open Source license listing or similar.
Often I suspect my email address is just about the only address listed that
the user can find.

Users with car problems can find my email in their cars. Guess if I get the
occasional email about seemingly random car problems?

## Update software

    Daniel -

    I recently purchased a 2009 BMW Z4. The iDrive software indicates
    “Copyright (c) 1996-2010, Daniel Stenberg). I’ve purchased a video
    interface that allows me to add a backup camera. However, the interface
    requires that I update the iDrive software to the latest version from
    BMW. However, there is no software update function within the current
    iDrive menu. Is there a way to revert the iDrive to the original or
    current software?

## Navigation update

    Hi

## Opel Insignia

    Dear Daniel Stenberg!
    My name is ****** ****** from Hungary. I write to you, because I have a
    problem with my cars Infotainment system, and I found your name in the
    vehicle instruction manual. I've bought a brand new Opel Insignia Sports
    Tourer in December 2018, from an official Opel dealer in Hungary.
    Unfortunately, with in a week, a problem has come up with the Infotainment
    System, which is the newest Multimedia Navi Pro system:
    The WI-FI Networks menu point has grayed out (I can't open it), after I
    activated the OnStar services. Later I asked the OnStar serice center to
    switch it off but nothing has changed. I want to emphasise that during the
    first few days, after I took the car from the dealer, it was working well,
    and I could open properly this menu point, and since activating the OnStar
    system it has gone wrong. What could be the problem, and why I can't reach
    this WI-FI networks menu point?
