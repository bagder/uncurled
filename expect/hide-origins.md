# People hide their origins

Even employees at large tech companies or producers of high volume devices
that your Open Source project will show up asking questions and demanding
actions, using seemingly anonymous or personal-looking email addresses. It is
a common practise to avoid using the company domain in emails to mailing lists
to avoid too easily revealing their association.

Sometimes this may of course be because said employee is actually working on a
side project on their spare time and truly is an invidual asking for help, but
in other cases it is done to hide for competitors that company X uses this
project, to make the user avoid comments (or hostility) from others about
company X but also to avoid it appearing as if company X that is making a lot
of money of their product looking for freebies (which they might be).
