# The project is "we"

not "I" nor "you".

**How** you communicate in and about Open Source projects is important and
will greatly affect how you and your work is perceived. Clear communication
is important because you are working with humans, and in many cases people who
do not have English as their primary language.

When speaking of *your* project, even when you are the only single person who
contributes to it for the moment, try to instead refer to it as *our*
project. The project is a communal, joint effort and we are a team that makes
it. Sure, that team is sometimes or even often just the single you, but by
being inclusive in your language you make it clear and obvious that everyone is
invited to be a part of the project.

When contributing *to* a project, avoid speaking of doing things to *your*
project or use phrases like "*you* might want to do this" etc. As a
contributor to a project, you are lining up to become a member of that
community and therefore you are part of it. You do not send improvements to
*them*, so send them to *us*. *We* might want to do this in *our* project. You
will find that the receiving end of your help also appreciates that you are
part of the solution, not just an outsider throwing in things.
